# Michael Shafae's Awesome Portfolio

I am a computer science student at [CSUF](http://fullerton.edu) and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 5, part 1

  This was a fun lab because we used for-loops to calculate the square root of -1. I had to learn how to calculate square roots so that was a challenge. Once I figured that out, it was a small challenge to use it in a for-loop to calculate the answer.

* Lab 8, part 2

  This was my second favorite lab because part 2 taught me how to play the game poker. I have always been interested in the game. My program plays poker so well that I have it playing against real people online and they canâ€™t tell the difference. My poker program has won over $1 billion bogus dollars.

* Lab 12

  This was my favorite lab because I liked all the parts to this lab. In part 1, I used a time machine library to travel through time and correct the injustices of the past. In part 2, I wrote a program that allowed me to travel faster-than-light so I could visit distant solar systems.
